#!/bin/bash
# proton_run.sh <exe> [args...]: run a cross-built Windows test under Proton
# (umu-run) and exit with its exit code. Meant as CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR,
# so ctest can run the mingw-built tests on a Linux host:
#   cmake -S tests/fist -B build/fist-win \
#         -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake \
#         -DCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR=$PWD/tests/proton_run.sh
#   cmake --build build/fist-win && ctest --test-dir build/fist-win
#
# The exe runs from a generated batch file, which sends stdout/stderr to a
# file (plain umu-run drops the program's stderr) and appends the exit
# code; the file is printed afterwards. A batch file because Wine escapes
# the quotes of a quoted argument as \", which cmd.exe /c can't parse.
# Inside a distrobox, umu-run is reached through distrobox-host-exec.
# RECOMP_* variables are passed on explicitly. Arguments are quoted (a %
# is doubled); ones holding a double quote are not supported.
#
# Environment: WINEPREFIX (default ~/.local/share/proton-test), PROTONPATH
# (GE-Proton), GAMEID (umu-default), PROTON_RUN_TIMEOUT (180 s),
# PROTON_RUN_LOCK (a file to flock around the run; unset: no lock).
