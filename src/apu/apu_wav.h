 * apu_wav.h -- the WAV tap on the APU's output (RECOMP_AUDIO_WAV).
 *
 * Writes exactly the samples handed to the host device -- 48 kHz, 16-bit
 * stereo, after the mixdown, tone and software mixer -- so what a check reads
 * is what was played.
 *
 * The header is valid at every point a run can end: it is rewritten with the
 * current sizes once per second of audio (so a hard kill loses at most the
 * last second), and finalised by apu_wav_close, which mcpx_apu_shutdown, an
 * atexit handler and (on Windows) the console-control handler all call. The
 * watchdog's _exit skips atexit, so it calls apu_wav_close_nowait first.
