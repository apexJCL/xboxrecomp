/*
 * recomp_exit_hook.h - work that must run when a window ends the process.
 *
 * The Win32 windows end the run with ExitProcess, which skips atexit. The
 * kernel's exit-time reports (the missing-file summary) register here, and
 * each window calls recomp_exit_hook_run before ExitProcess. It lives in the
 * platform layer because the D3D library is linked without the kernel in
 * its standalone tests, so it cannot call the kernel by name.
