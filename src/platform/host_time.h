/*
 * host_time.h - a monotonic nanosecond clock and a sleep that honours it.
 *
 * The kernel's vblank schedule, the frame-pacing trace and a title's own
 * pacers (a BlockUntilVerticalBlank loop) all need sub-millisecond time.
 * Sleep() is whole milliseconds and, on native Windows without
 * timeBeginPeriod, rounds to the 15.6 ms system tick; a schedule run on it
 * fires vblanks milliseconds off their edges.
 *
 * xbox_HostNowNs reads the same performance counter on Windows that the
 * kernel's millisecond clock reads, so ms and ns deadlines compare on one
 * clock. xbox_HostSleepNs may return early or late (signals, Wine's timer
 * server): callers re-read the clock against their absolute deadline rather
 * than trusting it.
