 * found the gate held used to be held off for a while (the APU 50 frames,

 * draining, with no linked check: run beside the DPC it inserted one node
 * twice, the node pointed at itself, and the DPC looped on it forever (a
 * results screen that never came back).
 *
 * So a busy gate makes the model post the line instead, and the holder runs
 * the routine on its own thread at its next safe point: a kernel call, a
 * spin-wait yield, or the gate's release before it is let go. Those are
 * where guest code already calls into the host, outside any guest
 * read-modify-write. A serviced MMIO trap is not one: it runs inside a
 * signal handler (POSIX) or a vectored handler (Windows). A guest poll loop
 * at DISPATCH that needs the interrupt is lowered through spin_waits.json,
 * which makes it a yield; the wait log below names it.

 * x86 port I/O
 *
 * The lifter turns `in`/`out` into these. The MCPX decodes I/O space: its
 * ACPI/PM block sits at 0x8000 and SMBus at 0xC000, and the kernel exports
 * cover SMBus, so a title touches ports directly only for the odd pin.
 *
 * 0x80C0 is the first GPIO register of the ACPI block. Bit 5 is the field pin
 * of the video encoder: D3D's vblank ISR stores !bit5 in [device+0x1DF8], and
 * D3DDevice_GetDisplayFieldStatus reports D3DFIELD_ODD while that is set.
 * Interlaced output alternates fields every vblank, so the pin follows the
 * parity of the vblank count. A constant answer says "odd field" for ever,
 * and the XDK's XMV player only starts its clock on an even one: Burnout 3's
 * EA intro waited on its loading screen indefinitely.
 *
 * Without vblanks (RECOMP_VBLANK off) the count stays 0, so the pin toggles
 * per read instead; then it at least alternates.
 *
 * Every other port reads 0 and is logged on first use, once per port.

 * cpuid
 *
 * The Xbox CPU is a 733 MHz Coppermine-based Pentium III. Leaf 1 eax 0x683
 * is family 6, model 8 (Coppermine), stepping 3: the cB0 stepping's
 * signature in Intel's Pentium III Processor Specification Update.
 * The max basic leaf is 2 and there are no extended leaves. Leaf 1's edx is
 * the P3 feature set (FPU..CMOV, PAT, PSE-36, MMX, FXSR, SSE). Leaf 2 gives
 * the Coppermine Celeron's descriptors (128 KB 4-way L2, 16 KB L1s, TLBs).
 *
 * A leaf above the maximum, extended ones included, returns the highest
 * basic leaf's data: Intel SDM vol. 2A, CPUID, "If a value entered for
 * CPUID.EAX is higher than the maximum input value for basic or extended
 * function for that processor then the data for the highest basic
 * information leaf is returned." So 0x80000000 reads eax 0x03020101, below
 * 0x80000001, which is how software learns there are no extended leaves.
 *
 * MMX is masked unless RECOMP_DEBUG=cpuid_mmx is set. D3DX's JPEG decoder
 * takes an MMX IDCT when the bit is set, and that path has never run in a
 * lifted title. Masking only bit 23 would describe a CPU with SSE but no
 * MMX, which never existed: SSE's integer extensions operate on the MMX
 * registers, and FXSAVE/FXRSTOR (FXSR) arrived alongside SSE to save that
 * state. So the masked CPU drops MMX, FXSR and SSE together (bits 23-25)
 * and reads as a plain P6 feature set -- self-consistent, if not the
 * family/model leaf 1 eax still names.
