/**
 * Xbox Memory Layout Implementation
 *
 * Maps the XBE data sections to their expected virtual addresses on Windows.
 * This is critical for the recompiled code which references globals by
 * absolute address (e.g., mov eax, [0x004D532C]).
 *
 * Implementation:
 * 1. VirtualAlloc a contiguous region at XBOX_BASE_ADDRESS
 * 2. Copy .rdata and initialized .data from the XBE
 * 3. Zero-fill the BSS region
 * 4. Set memory protection (read-only for .rdata)

 * 0xF0000000, and the NV2A, MCPX and flash apertures near the top. Reserving
 * only RAM and its mirrors, and letting the OS pick the base, leaves the rest
 * to luck. Under Wine the base landed at host 0x7FFF0000, so the contiguous
 * window fell on host 0xFFFF0000, which was taken (error 487). The kernel page
 * inside it went with it, and the title faulted reading guest 0x8000FFF0.
 *
 * So reserve 4 GB (or base + mirrors, if that is more) as one placeholder
 * (VirtualAlloc2 + MEM_RESERVE_PLACEHOLDER). Each window is then carved out of
 * it: split the placeholder (VirtualFree MEM_RELEASE|MEM_PRESERVE_PLACEHOLDER)
 * and replace that piece with a view (MapViewOfFile3) or with private memory
 * (VirtualAlloc2), both with MEM_REPLACE_PLACEHOLDER. Nothing else in the
 * process can be placed inside the window in between. One exception, opt-in:
 * under RECOMP_EXT_VMA the range above the mirrors is released outright for
 * upstream's guest_vmem, which reserves it with a plain VirtualAlloc. Another
 * thread could take it in that gap; guest_vmem then reports the reservation
 * failed and stays off, which is detectable, not corrupting.
 *
 * Both functions are resolved at run time from kernelbase.dll: they need
 * Windows 10 1803 or later, and Wine has them too. Without them, the fallback
 * looks for a free 4 GB hole and maps into it without holding it (see
 * win_reserve_guest_window).
 *
 * POSIX hosts do not use any of this. They keep the base + mirrors span in
 * xbox_MemoryLayoutInit, which works there because munmap can release part of
 * a mapping. */

 * The same channel's pointers on the PFIFO side of the aperture.
 *
 * The USER area above is the window software writes through; PFIFO holds the
 * engine's own copy, and D3D reads it back on the path where the USER pointer
 * is not usable. The title's channel context switch saves and restores all
 * four of these as one block (DDS9 0x002FE2xx), which is what identifies them:
 *
 *   0x3240 CACHE1_DMA_PUT          0x3248 CACHE1_REF
 *   0x3244 CACHE1_DMA_GET          0x324C CACHE1_DMA_SUBROUTINE
 *
 * DMA_SUBROUTINE matters because it is not a flag: bits 31:1 are the offset
 * the engine returns to when a pushbuffer subroutine ends, and bit 0 says
 * whether one is running. DDS9's free-space calculation (sub_002F6CC0) reads
 * the USER GET first and falls back to this register's return offset when
 * that lands outside the ring -- i.e. "the GPU is off in a subroutine, so ask
 * where it will come back to". Zeroed RAM answers 0 to both, which is below
 * the ring base, and the free-space subtraction then goes negative and is
 * clamped to zero. The reserve wants 0x2000 bytes, gets 0, and spins.
 *
 * Not acknowledged here, only reported. DDS9 reads the USER pair and never
 * reaches the fallback, so every value in this block is zero for the one
 * title that was traced -- mirroring PUT to GET would be a guess dressed as
 * a handshake. The watchdog prints them so the next title to spin here is
 * diagnosed from data instead.

 * AC'97 bus-master reset, modelled by trapping the write rather than by
 * clearing the bit afterwards.
 *
 * Each of the three DMA channels -- PCM In, PCM Out, Mic In -- has a one-byte
 * control register at NABM + 0x0B, and bit 1 is RR, "Reset Registers".
 * Software sets it and waits for the controller to clear it. DDS9 does that
 * inside DirectSoundCreate, and the wait is worth quoting because it is not a
 * poll:
 *
 *     mov  cl, [eax+0xFEC0010B]
 *     and  cl, 2
 *   L: test cl, cl
 *     jne  L
 *
 * MSVC hoisted the load out of the loop -- the pointer was not volatile -- so
 * the title reads the register exactly ONCE, a few instructions after writing
 * it, and spins forever on whatever that single read returned. On hardware
 * the reset has long completed by then.
 *
 * That rules out the NV2A_ACK approach. A thread that clears the bit
 * afterwards is racing a window a few instructions wide and gets only one
 * attempt; measured, it loses, and the title sits on a stale cl = 2 while the
 * register itself reads 0. The bit has to be clear at the moment of the read,
 * which means the write must never deposit it.
 *
 * So the page is PAGE_READONLY: reads run at full speed and see plain memory,
 * writes fault. The fault handler makes the page writable, single-steps the
 * faulting instruction, then masks RR out of the three control bytes and
 * re-protects. No instruction decoding, which matters because the write forms
 * a compiler emits here are not worth enumerating -- and being wrong about
 * one would corrupt a register rather than fail visibly.
 *
 * Only RR. Bit 0 is RPBM, run/pause bus master, which software owns.

/*
 * The KickOff flush, and how long the title waits on it.
 *
 * D3D's KickOff sets PFB 0x100410 bit 16 (flush the write-combine buffers),
 * spins until it clears, and only then writes DMA_PUT. The ack loop below
 * clears it at the top of each tick, and a tick was the scan of the last
 * segment plus a Sleep(1). A title can kick ~16 times a frame, so on macOS it
 * spent ~19 ms of every 33 ms frame in that spin with nothing drawn -- and
 * whatever the walker's draws cost was added on top (a simulated 9.5 ms of
 * draw per frame made it 28.6 ms).
 *
 * Acknowledging the flush on another thread at once does not work: the
 * title then runs a segment or more ahead, its MakeSpace finds
 * more than 8 KB outstanding, puts a NOP-with-notify in the pushbuffer and
 * blocks on the GPU interrupt that would answer it -- which nothing here
 * raises, so it waits forever. The flush wait is what keeps the title within
 * one segment of the walker.
 *
 * So the ack loop keeps the job, but polls every ~50 us between ticks while
 * the title is kicking (RECOMP_FAST_KICK, default on; =0 is the old
 * Sleep(1)). A kick then waits for the walker to finish the segment before
 * it, not for a timer, and the walker starts on a new PUT within ~50 us.
 *
 * With RECOMP_FLIP_LOG an observer thread watches the bit, so the [PB-PERF]
 * line can say how many kicks a frame made and how long they waited.

 * then compares the two. That holds for any address in this window and for
 * nothing in the general heap, whose position depends on what the title
 * reserved first -- Half-Life 2 reserves 128 MB and then 200 MB before D3D
 * allocates its pushbuffer, which put the buffer at 0x15782000 and left the
 * engine comparing 0x857844C0 against it forever.
 *
 * This was a bump allocator on the theory that contiguous blocks are
 * framebuffers and pushbuffers, allocated once. They are also every texture
 * and vertex buffer a D3D title creates, and those come and go with the scene:
 * a title may free and reallocate them as each texture pack loads, and with
 * nothing reclaimed the 64 MB window ran out at about 119 s into one
 * title's run. MmFreeContiguousMemory meanwhile passed the address to
 * xbox_HeapFree, which never matched it.
 *
 * Now a first-fit page allocator: one byte of state per 4 KB page, plus the
 * length of each allocation at its first page. 16,384 pages, so a linear scan
 * is cheap next to the memset every allocation already does. Honours the
