/**
 * The pushbuffer executor's decoded NV2A state, and the backend hook table.
 *
 * nv2a_pb_exec.c walks the title's pushbuffer and decodes it into the structs
 * below: surfaces, vertex arrays, the batch being built, texture registers,
 * the transform program and its constants, combiners and depth state. Drawing
 * is a separate concern. A backend gets events (clear, depth clear, draw,
 * flip, and optionally the visibility-test ones: zpass enable, report clear,
 * report, idle poll) and reads whatever else it needs from this state,
 * read-only.
 *
 * The default backend is the CPU rasteriser in nv2a_pb_exec.c. A GPU backend
 * (D3D11, Metal) registers itself with nv2a_pb_set_backend() and replaces it.
 *
 * Everything here runs on the NV2A ack thread, which drives the executor. The
 * state pointers stay valid for the life of the process, but the contents are
 * only consistent inside a hook call.
 *
 * Texture caches (one per backend: ARGB buffers for the CPU path, textures for
 * a GPU one) use the same key and invalidation policy, so the two agree on
 * when a texture is stale. Key: offset + format + width + height + pitch,
 * plus the mip level count for a backend that uploads more than level 0
 * (the CPU path samples level 0, so its count is always 1). Invalidation: a
 * per-flip generation, plus a hash of the whole texture, every uploaded
 * level included (nv2a_tex_hash, on every path). A first/last-page
 * fingerprint, which the CPU path once used, is not enough: a letterboxed
 * movie texture is black at both ends, so it changes only in the middle.
