/**
 * Execute the parts of the title's pushbuffer that produce visible pixels.
 *
 * The title builds NV2A commands in guest RAM and advances DMA_PUT; without
 * something consuming them the framebuffer stays whatever it was, which is how
 * a fully booted title renders a black screen. This walks the same command
 * stream nv2a_pb_scan.c surveys and carries out the subset that decides what is
 * on screen: which surface is being drawn into, and clearing it.
 *
 * It also rasterises geometry, but only the part that can be drawn honestly:
 * batches whose attribute 0 is already in screen space, flat-shaded, straight
 * into the same guest framebuffer the clear writes. Titles draw their UI, HUD
 * and 2D overlays that way, so it is the first geometry to appear. Batches that
 * need a vertex program executed are counted and skipped rather than drawn
 * somewhere wrong -- see raster_batch(). Texturing, depth and vertex programs
 * are still a renderer, not a command decoder; the upgrade path is the D3D11
 * translator in src/nv2a/nv2a_pgraph_d3d11.c.
 *
 * Everything this does not handle is counted and ranked by
 * nv2a_pb_exec_report(), so what remains is a list rather than a guess.
 *
 * Enabled with RECOMP_PB_EXEC. RECOMP_RASTER_TEST draws one known triangle
 * after every clear, which separates "the pixel path is broken" from "the title
 * has not given us any vertices". RECOMP_DEBUG=fb_dump=<prefix> writes the surface to
 * <prefix>NNN.bmp, so the result can be looked at without a display.

 * not a guest virtual address, and this executor has always used it as one.
 * That is harmless while the two happen to agree and catastrophic when they do
 * not: the Xbox Dashboard names surface 0x00088000 at 1280x960x4, so clearing
 * it wrote 4.9 MB of opaque black from 0x00088000 to 0x00538000 -- straight
 * over its own code, its D3D context at 0x000BBFC0 and the register-block
 * pointer at 0x000BE2C4. The symptom was a title that submitted one perfect
 * frame and then spun forever in a pushbuffer-full loop, three layers away,
 * with every D3D global reading 0xFF000000: the clear colour.
 *
 * So refuse, and say so. Getting the address right needs the DMA object base
 * this ignores (NV097_SET_CONTEXT_DMA_COLOR); until that exists, writing
 * nothing is strictly better than writing over the guest, and a title that
 * cannot draw is easier to debug than one that has been overwritten.

 *
 * NV097_SET_SURFACE_COLOR_OFFSET is an offset inside the colour DMA object,
 * and for a framebuffer that object covers physical memory -- so the offset
 * is a physical address, not a guest VA. Those are the same number in this
 * runtime, which is why treating it as a VA works until it does not: on
 * hardware the image is mapped at VA 0x00010000 from arbitrary physical
 * pages, so a framebuffer at physical 0x84000 does not overlap it. Here it
 * would.
 *
 * The title tells us which it is by where it allocated. Half-Life 2's
 * framebuffer comes from MmAllocateContiguousMemory, which this runtime
 * serves from the window at XBOX_CONTIG_BASE, so physical P is visible at
 * XBOX_CONTIG_BASE + P -- clear of the image, and the same bytes the title's
 * own writes and the framebuffer window reach.
 *
 * So: use the offset as a VA when that is credible, and fall back to the
 * physical mirror exactly when it is not. Titles whose surfaces already sit
 * in ordinary RAM (Wreckless renders to the tiled alias of physical
 * 0x01954000) keep the first path and are unaffected.

     * mark is memory some MmAllocateContiguousMemory call returned. The
     * title's own writes go through the window, so the executor's must too.
     *
     * Checking this BEFORE the image test is the whole point. The image test

/* ── Present surface ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Which colour surface a flip puts on screen, decided here for every backend
 * (nv2a_pb_present_state() in nv2a_pb_state.h).
 *
 * Not color_offset: by FLIP_STALL the XDK has already pointed that at the
 * next back buffer. Not the last surface drawn into either: a title renders
 * glow, shadow and downsample targets too, sometimes last -- one title
 * ends each frame in a 320x240 downsample, and presenting that put
 * an inset on screen (D3D11) or dumped the wrong buffer (CPU).
 *
 * The rule is size first. A surface is the colour offset plus the size the
 * clip gives it, as the draws and clears that used it saw it. The size wanted
 * is the display's: that of the surface at the address AvSetDisplayMode
 * scans out (the largest, if the title used it at more than one size), or,
 * with no display mode yet, of the largest surface seen; and the pitch is
 * the display's too, once there is a display mode. A run of draws with the
 * clip at 640x480 but offset and pitch still those of the 320x240 target
 * (seen on the odd frame) is 640x480 but nothing the display could
 * scan out. Of the surfaces that size, the one drawn into most recently
 * since the last flip wins; if none
 * was, the one cleared most recently; if none was either, the frame on
 * screen stays. Nothing carries over from one flip to the next, so a stray
 * flip with an odd target bound decides that flip and no other.
 *
 * Three guards on that rule:
 *
 *  - The display address and a surface's offset are compared as physical
 *    addresses (low 28 bits). AvSetDisplayMode resolves the address it is
 *    given by its own rule (kernel_bridge.c: XBOX_CONTIG_BASE + fb whenever
 *    fb is below 64 MB), dma_resolve by another (the bare offset above the
 *    arena), and the two must not have to agree for the pick to work.
 *
 *  - Only surfaces the display could scan out set the size: the pitch test
 *    applies to the size scan too, and a surface not drawn or cleared for
 *    present_stale flips (RECOMP_DEBUG, default 120) is stale. At the display address the largest
 *    fresh surface sets the size; when only stale ones sit there, the
 *    largest of those still does, so no candidate qualifies and the screen
 *    stays (a pause screen, or a smaller surface drawn elsewhere while the
 *    back buffers idle, cannot take over). Only when nothing at all sits at
 *    the display address does the largest fresh surface anywhere set it.
 *    Without the staleness test an entry left from an earlier, larger display
 *    mode at a reused address would pin the size for the rest of the run, no
 *    surface of that size is ever drawn again, and the screen freezes on the
 *    last pick before the mode change.
 *
 *  - Field rendering (D3DPRESENTFLAG_FIELD): half-height back buffers at
 *    twice the display's pitch. When no surface since the last display mode
 *    set has had the display's own pitch (once seen, s_pitch_seen latches it,
 *    stale or later evicted; a mode set clears it, since buffers drawn
 *    before it say nothing about the new mode), a surface at twice it
 *    qualifies instead, with a warning the first time. The runtime does not interleave fields anywhere, so such a
 *    pick shows one field; it beats presenting the buffer about to be drawn. */

 * A title running a vertex program hands over object-space positions that mean

 * skipped rather than drawn somewhere wrong. Upgrade path is the D3D11
 * translator in src/nv2a/nv2a_pgraph_d3d11.c once vertex programs are

 * rather than recollection: 0x1E is LIN_X8R8G8B8 and not, as this first read
 * it, a byte-reversed BGRA. Getting that one wrong turned an opaque black
 * render target into a screen of pure blue, which is the kind of wrong that
 * looks like content.
 *
 * Only the linear (LIN_) formats are read. A swizzled texture stores its
 * texels in Morton order rather than in rows, so reading one as if it had a
 * pitch does not give a slightly wrong colour, it gives a different image --
 * and inventing that image is exactly what this is not for. An unsupported
 * format samples nothing and the caller keeps the vertex colour, which is
 * visibly wrong rather than quietly wrong.
 *
 * Filtering is the stage sampler's (stage_sample_2d): nearest, or bilinear

 * picks when MIN mipmaps (stage_sample_mip).

/* ── Vertex programs ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The title-stage geometry is drawn through NV2A vertex programs: attribute 0
 * is object space and only the program knows where it lands. So the executor
 * keeps the transform unit's state -- 136 program slots, 192 constants, the
 * execution mode and the inline attribute values -- and runs the program per
 * vertex on the CPU (nv2a_vsh_cpu.c). XDK D3D appends a viewport epilogue to
 * every program, so oPos arrives already in surface pixels with the clip-space
 * w beside it, which is everything the rasteriser needs.
 *
 * A batch takes this path when SET_TRANSFORM_EXECUTION_MODE says PROGRAM.
 * Fixed-function mode keeps the old screen-space path: no title run so far
 * sends a fixed-function matrix (no SET_MODEL_VIEW/COMPOSITE_MATRIX in the
 * stream), so there is nothing to synthesise yet, and the report says if that
 * changes.
 *
 * RECOMP_PB_VSH=0 turns the path off, which is the A/B switch for comparing
 * dumps against the old executor.
 *
 * Texture stages 0..3 and the register combiners are evaluated per pixel (see
 * rc_eval); RECOMP_PB_RC=0 falls back to stage 0 modulated by oD0.
 *
 * Triangles that reach behind the eye (w <= 0) or far off the surface are
 * clipped in homogeneous space before the divide (clip_tri, next to
 * raster_batch_vsh_one). Depth is a private float buffer, not the title's
 * zeta surface, which nothing else here reads.

/* ---- RECOMP_PB_FAST: the same arithmetic, reordered --------------------
 *
 * Three fast paths for raster_tri_xf, on by default; RECOMP_PB_FAST=0 keeps
 * the reference loop above. Each one moves work out of the pixel loop without
 * changing a single operation that produces a pixel, so the two paths agree
 * bit for bit -- RECOMP_PB_FAST_AB=1 checks exactly that, per batch.
 *
 *  (a) Decoded-texture cache. A bound texture is decoded to ARGB8888 once, in
 *      8x8 tiles on first touch, through sample_tex itself (so the decode is
 *      the reference decode). Key and invalidation follow nv2a_pb_state.h:
 *      offset + format + width + height + pitch; a new flip generation
 *      re-fingerprints the texture and drops the tiles if it changed. (The
 *      shared policy says first and last page; that misses a letterboxed
 *      movie, see tc_fingerprint, so this hashes every byte.) Texels are widened to floats through a 256-entry table holding
 *      exactly what rc_unpack computes.
 *  (b) Combiner setup hoisted. rc_eval re-decodes every input word per pixel
 *      and copies the 256-byte register file twice per stage. The plan below
 *      is decoded once per batch; per pixel the registers are evaluated in
 *      place (every input of a stage is read before any output is written,
 *      which is what the nr copy guaranteed), and only registers something
 *      writes are reset between pixels.
 *  (c) Edge setup per row. Each edge function is monotonic along a row, so the
 *      columns that can pass the inside test are found per row from an
 *      estimate refined with the exact per-pixel expression, and the columns
 *      outside are never visited. Inside, the edge functions are the reference
 *      expressions with their per-triangle operands hoisted, which leaves the
 *      rounding where it was. Additive stepping would round differently and is
 *      deliberately not used. With all three w == 1 (the pretransformed
 *      passthrough quads) the 1/w weights are skipped, and the normalising
 *      divide is skipped whenever its divisor is exactly 1.
 *
 * ponytail: a texture rewritten between two batches of one flip is not seen
 * (the policy's known gap); RECOMP_PB_FAST_AB reports it if it ever happens.

 * afterwards, in the order one thread would have produced them; a texture
 * cache tile is filled under s_tc_lock and published with a release store.
 * A batch that samples the surface it draws into reads pixels other rows
 * write, so it stays on one thread (s_fast_serial), as does the reference

 * The XDK epilogue leaves oPos as (x/w * scale + offset, ..., w): screen
 * pixels, already divided, with the clip-space w beside them. Multiplying
 * back by w gives (x*w, y*w, z*w, w), which is an affine image of clip space
 * (the viewport offset times w is linear in w), so a point on an edge in clip
 * space is the same linear blend here, and Sutherland-Hodgman can run on it
 * directly. The divide's reciprocal is rcc, which keeps the sign, so this
 * holds for w < 0 too.
 *
 * Planes, in order:
 *   w >= CLIP_W_EPS                     the near plane the hardware clips to
 *   -CLIP_GUARD <= x, y <= CLIP_GUARD   a guard band, so a vertex just in
 *                                       front of the eye does not hand the
 *                                       edge functions 1e8-pixel operands
 *   0 <= z <= zmax                      with depth on only: the NV2A culls
 *                                       fragments outside [zmin, zmax]

 *
 * A triangle with all three vertices inside every plane goes to the
 * rasteriser untouched, so nothing that drew before changes by a bit. Only
 * the vertices clipping creates are interpolated; the polygon is fanned from
 * its first vertex, which keeps its winding, so culling still sees the
 * triangle's real facing. Attributes blend linearly in clip space, exactly as
 * the hardware's clipper does.
 *
 * RECOMP_PB_CLIP=0 restores the old rule (drop any triangle with a vertex at
 * w <= 0 or beyond 1e6 pixels), for before/after comparisons.
