/**
 * A Metal backend for the pushbuffer executor (struct nv2a_pb_backend), the
 * macOS sibling of nv2a_pb_d3d11.c.
 *
 * The executor (src/kernel/nv2a_pb_exec.c) decodes the title's pushbuffer into
 * the state in nv2a_pb_state.h and calls the hooks of struct nv2a_pb_backend;
 * this file answers them with Metal instead of the CPU rasteriser:
 *
 *   on_clear  -> a render pass with loadAction Clear on the surface at
 *                color_offset (one MTLTexture per guest surface, grown to
 *                its largest clip); a clear of part of it (clip, clear
 *                rect) is a scissored draw of the clear colour
 *   on_draw   -> vertex-program batches through the program as MSL
 *                (d3d8_vsh_msl.c), pre-transformed (screen-space) ones through
 *                a pass-through vertex function; pixels through the register
 *                combiners as MSL (d3d8_combiners_msl.c) when they are
 *                programmed, else MODULATE. Four stages, textured from the
 *                shared decode (nv2a_backend_common.h).
 *   on_flip   -> commit and wait; with the CAMetalLayer window up
 *                (fb_present_metal.m, whose device and queue this backend
 *                adopts), blit the surface the walker picked for this flip
 *                (nv2a_pb_present_state) into the window's back slot and
 *                publish it: no CPU copy. Under metal_present=readback the
 *                texture is read back for the SDL renderer window
 *                (xbox_FramebufferWindowPresentPixels) as before.
 *   sync_guest -> write a surface back to guest memory when the executor
 *                dumps it (RECOMP_FB_DUMP and the report): the write-back is
 *                on demand (metal_writeback=lazy, default), since the title
 *                never reads its present surface; metal_writeback=always,
 *                metal_no_rtt or a read caught by metal_fb_guard write it at
 *                every flip.
 *
 * Opt-in: RECOMP_PB_BACKEND=metal (nv2a_pb_metal_register_from_env). The CPU
 * rasteriser stays the default and the oracle.
 *
 * Rules this file keeps (from the M1 plan):
 *  - Shaders are compiled at runtime (newLibraryWithSource) with fast math off,
 *    so float results match the CPU path's IEEE arithmetic.
 *  - Constant structs are float4/uint4 only on the MSL side; the C structs they
 *    mirror are checked with _Static_assert, as the HLSL ABI is in the D3D11
 *    backend.
 *  - Encoders begin lazily (first clear or draw on a surface) and end
 *    explicitly on a render-target change, before a readback and at the flip;
 *    every pass loads (loadAction Load) unless it starts with a clear.
 *  - Only the present surface is written back to guest memory, on demand
 *    (sync_guest, a texture decode that overlaps it, its eviction), or at
 *    every flip under metal_writeback=always.
 *  - Guest memory is touched on the executor's thread only: no completion
 *    handlers; a write-back waits for the command buffer and then copies.
 *
 * Depth/stencil and render-to-texture as the D3D11 backend (M2); visibility
 * tests (GET_REPORT) from Metal visibility results through the shared
 * tracker (M3, "Visibility tests" below). Near clipping needs nothing extra:
 * the vertex programs hand Metal clip-space positions (w kept, as for D3D11)
 * and the default MTLDepthClipModeClip clips at the near and far planes, as
 * D3D11's DepthClipEnable does. Not yet: swizzled render targets. The mip
 * LOD bias is a sample() argument (MsPsConsts.tex_bias), not a sampler
 * field, so every macOS takes the same path.
 *
 * Everything runs on the NV2A ack thread (or the smoke test's main thread).
 *
 * Off macOS this file compiles to nothing.

 * drives it: BeginVisibilityTest is CLEAR_REPORT_VALUE +
 * SET_ZPASS_PIXEL_COUNT_ENABLE(1), EndVisibilityTest is ENABLE(0) +
 * GET_REPORT; each stretch with counting on is one query, and a report sums
 * the stretches since the last clear, completing later (poll at every batch
 * and flip, with a flush on the ack thread's idle tick) or as visible after
 * 250 ms. The count is samples passing depth and stencil, alpha-test discard
 * applied.
 *
 * A query here is a list of slots in s_vis, one per render pass it spans:
 * Metal resets, at the start of a pass, every offset that pass names (even
 * in setVisibilityResultMode:Disabled), so a slot never outlives its pass
 * and a stretch over a pass change takes a new one. Slots accumulate within
 * the pass. A result is in once every slot's command buffer has completed,
 * so GET_REPORT commits the open command buffer: a count held to the flip
 * lands a frame later than D3D11's, and light shafts whose brightness
 * comes from the count come out too bright. A slot freed while
 * its command buffer is still in flight retires until the flip's wait.
 *
 * RECOMP_METAL_OCC=sync waits at GET_REPORT; =fixed leaves reports to the
 * walker (RECOMP_ZPASS_FIXED, every test visible). */
