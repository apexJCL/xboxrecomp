"""Branches that leave a lifted body land on an entry, not a stub.

Each function and each alias is lifted as its own C body over [start, end). A
direct jmp or jcc whose target is outside that range becomes a tail call to
sub_<target>. When nothing starts at the target, that is an unresolved stub
which adds 4 to esp and returns, as if the guest had executed a `ret`. The
native chain unwinds and the guest frame does not.

The fixture is a function F split at a lone int3 into two primary bodies, A
and B. The halves and their aliases branch into each other's interiors:

- B has a `jne` into the middle of A. The tail-jump pass looks only at
  unconditional jumps, and the orphan pass looks only at gaps.
- An alias that starts partway into A and runs to A's end has a `jle` back
  to a label before its own start but inside its primary. Every pass tests
  "leaves its function" against the primary bodies, so it looks like an
  intra-function branch.

Before the closure pass both went to stubs: the function returned with its
frame still on the guest stack, and its caller recursed until the native
stack overflowed.
